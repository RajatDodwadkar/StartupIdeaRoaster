# Startup Idea Roaster 🔥  
**Brutally honest feedback for early-stage startup ideas**

Most startup feedback is uselessly polite.  
“Interesting idea.”  
“Sounds promising.”  
“Could work if executed well.”

This project exists to do the opposite.

Startup Idea Roaster stress-tests startup ideas the way a skeptical operator or early-stage investor would — early, honestly, and without encouragement.

---

## What This Is

Startup Idea Roaster is an AI-powered idea evaluator that:
- Critiques assumptions instead of hyping founders
- Flags common failure patterns early
- Focuses on willingness to pay, distribution, and behavior change
- Treats ideas as disposable, not precious

Think:
> A skeptical VC trash-talking your idea over chai — not LinkedIn comments.

---

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ A validation tool  
- ❌ A mentor or coach  
- ❌ A pitch-deck helper  
- ❌ A motivational product  

If you’re looking for encouragement, this repo will disappoint you quickly.

## Core Philosophy

- **Ideas are cheap**
- **Execution is irrelevant if the problem isn’t real**
- **Most ideas fail for predictable reasons**
- **Polite feedback is a tax on founders’ time**

The goal is not to be mean — it’s to be *useful*.

## Input

The system expects:
- A startup idea (plain text)
- Optional context:
  - Target users
  - Monetization
  - Geography

No traction assumed.  
No benefit of doubt given.

---

## Output Format

Each idea is evaluated using a fixed, non-negotiable structure:

### One-line Summary  
Blunt analogy that exposes what the idea really is.

### Reality Check  
- Is the problem real?
- Is it urgent or optional?
- Who actually pays?

### Why This Might Fail (Brutal Mode)  
3–5 uncomfortable but fair reasons most versions of this idea die.

### One Pivot That Makes It Better  
Exactly one improvement. No lists. No hedging.

### Fun Metrics  
Opinionated, non-scientific scores that reflect gut-level investor reaction:
- VC Laugh Probability
- Founder Delusion Score
- “Quit Job?” Score
- Copycat Vulnerability
- Time-to-Regret (Founder)

### Next 7-Day Action Plan  
Concrete validation steps based on real behavior, not opinions.

---

## Design Constraints (Very Important)

The system is explicitly designed to:
- Avoid buzzwords
- Avoid “this could work if…” language
- Avoid inspirational advice
- Avoid sounding like a consultant

If feedback sounds polite or vague, it is rewritten to be more direct.

---

## Why This Exists

Most founders don’t fail because they didn’t work hard.  
They fail because:
- No one told them the idea was weak early
- Validation was confused with compliments
- Real-world constraints were ignored

Startup Idea Roaster exists to shorten that failure loop.

---

## Who Should Use This

- First-time founders
- Builders testing multiple ideas
- Hackathon teams before committing months
- Anyone who wants signal instead of vibes

If you’re emotionally attached to your idea — don’t use this.

---

## Status

Early-stage.  
Opinionated by design.  
Accuracy improves with more ideas roasted.

This tool will sometimes be wrong.  
But polite feedback is *almost always* wrong.

---
Roast responsibly.
